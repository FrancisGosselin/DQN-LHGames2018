# Deep Q-Learning AI LHGAMES2018
This is the bot we made during the 10hours AI challenge of the LHGames.
Allthough we did not have the time to train it fully, we did have time 
to create a model adapted to the game using Theano and keras.

### Input and Outputs of the model
state (input) :
- game map

Q_values indexes (output):
0: go left
1: go right
2: go up
3: go down
4: attack
5: collect
6: purchase
7: upgrade 
8: drink potion
